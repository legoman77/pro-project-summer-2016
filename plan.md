# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Summer 2016

The goal of my project is to create a randomly generated RPG (role-playing game) in the Python programmming language.  In the game, the player will use text commands to move through a maze.  Some areas of the maze can be walked over, while others cannot.  The player will sometimes encounter enemies, which they must fight in turn-based battles.  They may also come across helpful items in the maze.  The game is won by finding the special exit tile in the maze.

## Objectives

* Create a basic randomly generated dungeon crawler/turn-based RPG
* Learn more about the Python programming language
* Get helpful advice from fellow programmers
* Gain more programming experience to improve my skills
